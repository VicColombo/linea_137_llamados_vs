# linea_137_llamados_vs

 ## Motivación
137 is an Argentinian national and public help line to which people can report cases of domestic and/or sexual violence and ask for inmediate help. 
This line was born in 2017 from a 2016 national help programme Las Víctimas contra las Violencias (Victims against Violence).


As part from my mid master's thesis in Data Science for the University of Buenos Aires, I intend to explore the available data about phone calls 
reporting and requiring assistance in cases of sexual violence between January 2017 and July 2021. My goal is to provide new insights regarding gender 
and sexual violence as well as explore the possible (positive) consequences derived from these kinds of public programmes in the path to exposing, 
understanding, and neutralizing these crimes.
