# linea_137_llamados_vs

 ## Motive
137 is an Argentinian national public help line for people suffering domestic and/or sexual violence. 
This line was born in 2017 from a 2016 national help programme Las VÃ­ctimas contra las Violencias (Victims against Violence).


As part of my mid master's thesis in Data Science for the University of Buenos Aires, I intend to explore the available datasets with phone calls 
reporting and requiring assistance in cases of sexual violence between January 2017 and July 2021. My goal is to provide new insights regarding gender 
and sexual violence as well as explore the possible (positive) consequences that could derived from these kinds of public programmes in the path to exposing, understanding, and neutralizing sexual violence.

## Repo guide

* [datasets](/datasets): 
    - [csv](/datasets/csv) with raw phone calls between 01/2017 and 08/2021,
    - [xlsx](/datasets/xlsx) a-d showing different versions of the complete concatenated phone calls dataset according to different filters or data cleaning processes applied[^1],
* [notebooks](/code/notebooks) and [scripts](/code/scripts) for cleaning and normalization.

[^1]: Dataset a has the least amount of modifications donde on the data, dataset d has the most.
